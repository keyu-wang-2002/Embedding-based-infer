# Open-source Code Documentation: An Embedding-based Approach to Inconsistency-tolerant Reasoning with Inconsistent Ontologies



### The source code is divided into four parts:

- MCS generator
- NaturalOWL tool 
- TripleOWL tool
- Scoring function



**MCS generator**  is used to generate the maximal consistent subsets of inconsistent ontology. 

**NaturalOWL tool** is used to translate axioms into natural language sentence forms. 

**TripleOWL tool** is used to translate axioms into triple forms.

**scoring function** is used to score the maximal consistent subsets using methods defined in our paper.



Detailed instructions for each part are attached to the corresponding code folder.
